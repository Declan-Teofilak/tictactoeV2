I finally got around to implementing a proper win method in my Java Tic Tac Toe game!

I decided to use what I have learned about multidimensional arrays to create what might be a convoluted, but fully functional win condition check method!

I also added a function that clears the board and displays a win message

You'll notice that the console prints quite a bit of information, which was primarily there to help with the debugging process but also shows what exactly is happening under the hood.
